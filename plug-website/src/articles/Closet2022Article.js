          2023 was a year packed with trends, some of them coming in and out of
          vogue faster than most of us could keep up. Check out how many of
          these styles made it into your closet this year with our list of the
          top trends for 2022!
        </p>

        <p className="article-body text-2xl font-medium mt-[30px]">
          1. Blazers. In literally every form.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[16px]">
          Micro, oversized, vintage, designer- blazers took the world by storm.
          Blazers became a staple almost overnight, whether they were styled
          business casual or even worn to the club. As everything seems to be
          shrinking smaller, shorter, and tighter, it seems micro blazers will
          be the next move.

          alt="closet 1"
        />

        <p className="article-body text-2xl font-medium mt-[40px]">
          2. Dropping the waistline
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[16px]">
          Low rise jeans, cargo pants, mini skirts- the button doing up your
          pants moved from above to wayyy below the belly button in 2022.
          Nostalgia clearly kicked in this year as low rise everything became
          the height of style.
        </p>

          alt="closet 2"
        />

        <p className="article-body text-2xl font-medium mt-[40px]">
          3. Elevated lounge wear
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[16px]">
          While this trend may be more of a continuation of COVID’s comfortable
          fashion, it certainly didn’t go away. From matching sweatsuits to
          graphic hoodies- these timeless pieces got a facelift with flattering
          cuts and tasteful colours.
        </p>

          alt="closet 3"
        />

        <p className="article-body text-2xl font-medium mt-[40px]">
          4. Cut-outs, cropped, and keyholes
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[16px]">
          Long sleeve tops with cut-outs, keyholes on sleeves, and cropped shrug
          sweaters put a youthful spin on classic silhouettes. While they may be
          all the rage now, let’s just hope they don’t become the 2022 version
          of shirts with grommets and crisscross details (so 2016)!
        </p>

        />

        <p className="article-body text-2xl font-medium mt-[40px]">
          5. Neon and neutrals?
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[16px]">
          As fashion cycles, neon and neutral pieces usually swap out every
          couple years. However, 2022 saw both trends at the same time, often in
          cohesion. Many trends this year seem as though they’re from two very
          different closets, yet they often work in harmony.
        </p>

        <img
          className="mt-6 mb-2"
          src={require('./article_media/closet-2022/closet-5.jpg')}
          alt="closet 5"
        />

        <p className="article-body text-2xl font-medium mt-[40px]">
          6. Chunky platforms
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[16px]">
          Specifically for boots and loafers, chunky platforms became extremely
          popular, giving a fun edge to a classy look. Even heels got in on the
          action, with cartoon-esque Mary Jane heels trending this holiday
          season.
        </p>

        />

        <p className="article-body text-2xl font-medium mt-[40px]">
          7. Leather
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[16px]">
          Biker chick chic was all the rage this year. From long leather jackets
          to bomber jackets that are reminiscent of a trucker- this fad seems
          like it’ll be sticking around. This is one trend that is best thrifted
          for that worn-in look!
        </p>

        <img
          className="mt-6 mb-2"
          src={require('./article_media/closet-2022/closet-7.jpg')}
          alt="closet 7"
        />

        <p className="article-body text-2xl font-medium mt-[40px]">8. Uggs</p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[16px]">
          Though sparking some mixed feelings, Uggs made a massive comeback this
          year, especially this winter season. They may be warm and cozy, but
          just keep them away from that Vancouver rain!
        </p>

        />

        <p className="article-body text-2xl font-medium mt-[40px]">
          9. Retro sunglasses
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[16px]">
          A futuristic spin on an early 2000’s classic, sunnies were a hit this
          season beyond summer. From pit vipers to tiny shades, sunglasses were
          the accessory in 2022!
        </p>

        <img
          className="mt-6 mb-2"
          src={require('./article_media/closet-2022/closet-9.jpg')}
          alt="closet 9"
        />

        <p className="article-body text-2xl font-medium mt-[40px]">
          10. 90’s minimalism AND 2000’s maximalism
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[16px]">
          The best of two notably fashionable decades, trending in the same
          year. Minimalistic luxury of the 90’s collided with Y2K extravagant
          bubblegum pop, although not necessarily in the same outfit. That being
          said, both had notable resurgences, giving all those on a nostalgia
          trip the best of both worlds.
        </p>

        <img
          className="mt-6 mb-2"
          src={require('./article_media/closet-2022/closet-10.jpg')}
          alt="closet 10"
        />

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[16px]">
          Whether you wore or avoided these fads, perhaps the poignant fashion
          to come from this year of juxtaposing styles was the dichotomy of fast
          fashion and thrifting. In a year when micro-trends moved faster than
          ever, so did individuality and personal style. Thrifting was extremely
          popular, just as having unique pieces has become. The best trend that
          could happen in 2023 would be sustainable fashion- be environmentally
          conscious is always in!

          Back by popular demand: the series where I am in no way qualified to
          comment music at all, but I do anyway. Considering myself and SZA fans
          alike have waited 5 years for the album, I just simply had to review
          it.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[30px]">
          Blessing us with 23 tracks, SZA put her everything into this album,
          and simply left no crumbs to spare. Before even listening to the
          album, “SOS”’s cover art’s nod to Princess Diana (what an icon) set
          high expectations. When asked why she chose to replicate the infamous
          photo of the late royal, SZA explained “I pulled the Diana reference
          because I just loved how isolated she felt and that was what I wanted
          to convey the most”.
        </p>

        <img
          className="my-6 w-full"

        />

        <div className="text-center text-sm">

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[30px]">
          Immediately within jumping into her title track “SOS”, I could tell
          that this was not the same SZA who gave me the melancholy indie tracks
          I used to romanticize my life to when I was seventeen. SZA knows her
          audience is all grown up now, and she played to her crowd. On first
          impact lines like “you was at the farmers market with your perfect
          peach” in “Kill Bill” seem sweet and saccharine, but they serve to
          contrast SZA’s proclamation that she “might kill [her] ex” and that
          his “girlfriend is next”. It’s no wonder that “Kill Bill” has gone to
          take the charts, the world, and TikTok by storm. The singsong tunes
          coat the commanding beats on the album’s early tracks. If this album
          were a person, it’d be Maddy Perez from Euphoria, demanding the
          spotlight (as it should).
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[30px]">
          Continuing on, you can hear the confidence in “Kill Bill” subside to a
          raw emotion and vulnerability that clings to SZA’s stunning vocals.
          Track number five “Love Language” exemplifies this with lines like
          “You remind me I’m perfect and it sucks to admit it”, that feel as if
          you’re having a conversation with SZA herself. While the lyrics don’t
          hit quite as hard in track 6, the chorus of “Blind” is so transcendent
          it doesn’t even really matter. SZA chose “Blind” as one of two tracks
          to debut on Saturday Night Live on December 10th. Of course, Gen Z
          being the way Gen Z is, this beautiful song about being blind to love
          has already become a TikTok trend about literally not being able to
          see. I won’t lie though, with a -7.00 prescription I can’t help but
          relate.

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[30px]">
          When I reached “Used” which features Don Toliver, I had high hopes as
          it’s the first song on the album that collaborates with any other
          artist. Unfortunately, the song doesn’t meet the mark in comparison to
          SZA’s standalone tracks. “Used” is just a small fish in the big pond
          of “SOS”. When an album has twenty-three tracks, it’s easy for songs
          that aren’t necessarily colossal hits to get lost in the noise.
          Perhaps that’s why I felt extra drawn to “Snooze”, the song that
          follows “Used”. I found that “Snooze” triggers that all too familiar
          feeling of hitting your alarm for the thousandth time, just to realize
          it’s a Saturday so it didn’t matter in the first place. This feels as
          though this is another nod to SZA’s coming-of-age audience, pairing
          perfectly with ”Gone Girl”, which verbalizes growing pains in ways I
          didn’t know possible. SZA’s bittersweet lyrics call to something of
          the past, “Squeezing too tight boy you’re losing me… get around you
          and I regress… tired of repeating myself I digress… trying to grow
          without hating the process”. Every young adult knows all too well the
          throbbing pang of trying to grow into yourself while *perfectly*
          balancing relationships, a career, and your own wellbeing- all while
          trying not to miss a younger, more innocent version of yourself too
          much. The key change at the end almost symbolizes the melody evolving
          in itself.

        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[30px]">
          However, much to my surprise, the album takes a welcome twist that for
          a lack of better words feels almost... grungy? “F2F” sounds like it
          would have been on the radio in 2007, which is pretty much exactly
          what I’m looking for in music today. That angsty, nostalgic, “I hate
          you but I miss you” dichotomy is chock-full of nostalgia in the best
          way possible. “Nobody Gets Me” keeps the throwback vibe going, and is
          simply the R&B, NSFW version of a Hannah Montana song. If that doesn’t
          tell you that I’m obsessed with it, I simply don’t know what would. I
          will say I was hoping this energy would carry throughout more of the
          album, but “Conceited” felt just a bit basic in comparison to the last
          few tracks before it. There are a few songs that blur together, but I
          suppose that’s somewhat to be expected when writing 23 tracks. That’s
          not to say any of the songs are bad by any stretch, they all
          compliment “SOS” in their own respect. The songs are best-done justice
          standing alone, as each is a course in the meal- not a side dish on a
          plate.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg font-normal mt-[30px]">
          “Open Arms” redeems the last song with a feature, with comforting and
          dreamy melodies that easily cascaded into Travis Scott’s verses. In
          juxtaposition to “Used”, the track is much more natural and flows
          well. Of course the album rounds out “I Hate U” and “Good Days”, which
          are already hits and have taken the internet by storm. Then
          “Forgiveless” sounds like the perfect song for a breakup, or more
          fittingly, when I realize I can’t actually date this album. All in
          all, the emotion and sheer depth of “SOS” will have people who have
          never even heard of SZA fall in love with this album. With
          twenty-three tracks of thoughtful lyrics enveloped in such rich
          melodies, “SOS” truly has something for everyone. Each song feels so
          intentional and purposeful, and it’s clear the star’s audience is
          ready for this too. “SOS” itself aside, SZA’S Saturday Night Live
          performance included a parody skit about wanting “a big boy” for
          cuffing season. The sketch ended up being enormously popular, blowing
          on TikTok before the album was released. If “Big Boys” is any
          indication of the public’s appetite for SZA, then “SOS” might just
          become the biggest album of the year!
